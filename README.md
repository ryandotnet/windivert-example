# windivert-example
A basic WinDivert packet filtering and modification example. Modifies packets targeted for port 1234 to resolve to port 80 and vice-versa. 

This example requires [WinDivert](https://reqrypt.org/windivert.html) driver / library files as well as the header file. 

Thanks to basil00 for creating such a great library. The source code for WinDivert and further examples can be found [here](https://github.com/basil00/Divert).
